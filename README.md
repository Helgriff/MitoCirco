# MitoCirco

The MitoCirco pipeline is for the high-throughput analysis of Illumina Fastq format, paired-end, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence reads on a Linux Cluster (under OGS/GE). 
It automates the analysis from raw sequence reads through to files of annotated variants, heteroplasmic sites, haplogroup predictions and locations of Nuclear Mitochondrial sequences (Numts).
